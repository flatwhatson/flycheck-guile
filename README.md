# flycheck-guile

This library provides a [flycheck][] checker for the [GNU Guile][guile]
programming language.  It requires a working [Geiser][geiser] configuration, and
runs `guild compile` on your code to collect warnings and errors.

## Installation

### MELPA

This package is available on [MELPA][melpa].

After following MELPA's [Getting Started][melpa-getting-started] guide, you can
install this package with `M-x package-install flycheck-guile`.

### Guix

This package is available on [Guix][guix].

It can be installed to your user profile with `guix install
emacs-flycheck-guile`.

### Manual installation

To install it manually, just download this code add the directory to your Emacs
`load-path`.

## Usage

Call `(require 'flycheck-guile)` somewhere in your Emacs configuration to load
the checker.

Once loaded, the checker will automatically activate in `scheme-mode` buffers
with `geiser-mode`, where `guile` is the current scheme implementation.

## Configuration

This package can be configured via `M-x customize-group flycheck-guile`.

The `flycheck-guile-warnings` variable contains the list of warnings reported by
the compiler.  If you find a warning particularly annoying (eg. spurious "unused
variable" warnings), it can be suppressed by removing it from this list.

The `flycheck-guile-args` variable contains a list of additional arguments to be
passed to `guild compile`.  This can be useful to pass an `--r6rs` or `--r7rs`
argument argument when working with standard Scheme.

## Troubleshooting

If it seems like the checker is not working, try running `M-x
flycheck-verify-checker guile` for some diagnostics.

It may also be useful to run `M-x flycheck-compile guile`, which shows the full
compilation command and its output.

If the checker is working, but can't find your guile modules (ie. reporting "no
code for module" errors), make sure that you have correctly configured your
Geiser REPL.  The `geiser-guile-load-path` and `geiser-repl-add-project-paths`
variables control how Geiser sets up paths, and the checker also uses these to
determine the load path arguments for `guild compile`.

If your project has scheme files in the top-level, so the Guile module `(foo bar
baz)` is declared in `foo/bar/baz.scm`, set `geiser-repl-add-project-paths` to
`t` or `'(".")`.

If your project has scheme files in a sub-directory "src", so the Guile module
`(foo bar baz)` is declared in `src/foo/bar/baz.scm`, set
`geiser-repl-add-project-paths` to `'("src")`.
